        <p>The <em><strong>golden</strong></em> retriever has its roots in Scotland. In the mid-18th century, bird hunting was very popular with the wealthy, and a dog that could retrieve from water and land was needed, as the Scottish terrain is covered by lakes and rivers. <strong>The first</strong> retrievers were crossed with the best spaniels , giving rise to the breed of dog that is known as the <em>golden retriever.</em></p>
